        <h2>What is Flooding ?</h1>
        <p>Flooding is one of the most destructive natural disasters, capable of causing widespread devastation to communities, infrastructure, and the environment. It occurs when an area experiences an overflow of water, often due to heavy rainfall, melting snow, or the breaching of dams or levees. Floods can take many forms, ranging from flash floods that develop suddenly, to river and coastal floods that occur over longer periods. The impact of flooding can be catastrophic, leading to property damage, loss of life, and displacement of thousands of people. In addition to the immediate dangers, floods can disrupt essential services, contaminate water supplies, and lead to long-term economic and environmental challenges. As climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, understanding flood risks and preparedness measures has become more crucial than ever.</p>
